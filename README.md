This is a converted version of the [PPCHY](https://github.com/beatrice57/penn-parsed-corpus-of-historical-yiddish). It is converted using [PPCHYtoUD](https://github.com/beatrice57/penn-parsed-corpus-of-historical-yiddish), an adapted version of the [UDConverter](https://github.com/thorunna/UDConverter).

The corpus is also hosted on [ArboratorGrew](https://arborator.grew.fr/#/home) as [Santorini Yiddish UD](https://arborator.grew.fr/#/projects/Santorini%20Yiddish%20UD)

> [!NOTE]
> The converter is still a WIP which means that the UD files here are not a 100% truthful conversion of the original PPCHY yet.
